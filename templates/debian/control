Description: Synthesizer-cloning software
 synthclone is a Qt-based application that can "clone" your MIDI-capable
 instruments. It does this by sending out MIDI data that instructs an
 instrument to emit sounds for a series of notes, velocities, controls, and
 aftertouch values. It then saves this data as a sample-based instrument that
 can be loaded by sampler software.
 .
 This package contains the synthclone executable, the synthclone plugin
 library, and the standard plugins distributed with synthclone.
