`synthclone` is a Qt-based application that can "clone" your MIDI-capable
instruments.  It does this by sending out MIDI data that instructs an
instrument to emit sounds for a series of notes and velocities.  It then saves
this data as a sample-based instrument that can be loaded by sampler software.
