====================================

1. Build Requirements
---------------------

In order to compile `libsynthclone` and the `synthclone` executable, you must
have the following libraries (and their corresponding development packages)
installed:

  * jack
  * libarchive
  * libsamplerate
  * libsndfile
  * qt4

In addition, you'll need the following tools:

  * python
  * qmake

2. Building and Installing from Source
--------------------------------------

To build `synthclone`, change your current directory to the top-level directory
of the project and execute the command:

  python build.py --prefix=/usr

Optionally, you can use your own directory prefix.

To install `synthclone`, execute the command:

  make install

If you are a package maintainer, you may want to set the install path for
`synthclone` to a different location than the 'prefix' for packaging purposes.
To do this, execute:

  make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/some/location

Make sure that the path is not a relative path.
